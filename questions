Tuple Questions:  Link  

Given a Tuple List, Perform sort on the basis of total digits in tuple:-
     Input : test_list = [(3, 4, 6, 723), (1, 2), (134, 234, 34)] 
    Output : [(1, 2), (3, 4, 6, 723), (134, 234, 34)] 
             Explanation : 2 < 6 < 8, sorted by increasing total digits.
Extract digits from tuple list:-
              Input : test_list = [(15, 3), (3, 9)] 
              Output : [9, 5, 3, 1]

 Extract Symmetric Tuples:-
               Input : test_list = [(6, 7), (2, 3), (7, 6)] 
              Output : {(6, 7),(7,6)} 
              Input : test_list = [(6, 7), (2, 3)] 
             Output : {}

Extract dictionary with maximum keys : -
I/P: test_list = [{“gfg”: 2, “best” : 4}, {“gfg”: 2, “is” : 3, “best” : 4, “CS” : 9}, {“gfg”: 2}]
O/P: 4
